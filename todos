TODOs

- DONE get pellet location on a per trial basis
    - DONE: find frames in which the velocity becomes 0
    - DONE: interpolate between weird trials
    - DONE: plot pellet location, reach locations

- DONE get result of every grab attempt

- DONE screen trials
    - DONE develop csv format file for inclusion / exclusion
    - TODO: develop stacking code for video montage
    - bad trials:
        - extra pellet from prev trial
        - successful trials at the very end of recording, like trial 26.
        currently the best way to assess T/F is through chewing epochs, which overrides the drop
         signal

- DONE redo behavior
    - DONE copy behavior project, add new label of pellet_to_mouth, which should
    be the best predictor of success and failure.

- DONE random
    - DONE include labels on alienware comp onto this computer

- TODO:
    - ramp up and iterate through an entire mouse
    - test new model
    - refactor code
    - plot reach dynamics

truth table

DROP  GRAB_TO_MOUTH CHEW    RESULT
000 failed or disinterested, depending on grab
011 good, T
001 weird, check, T
010 weird, check, end of trial
100 failed

110 weird
101 weird
111 weird

depends on if dropped after or before. if after, failed after grab. if before,
false negative
